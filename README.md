# Print_Notifier
A program that pops up a notification window, when defined softwares are lunched (Tested for windows)

It took me a week to to develop this software.
I am not publishing the whole code (Because I made the app for a small company),
howver, the main codes, to show how this program works are here to find. ;)

# Note:
    even thought at this time the Python 3.9 is published, to be able to run
    and distrubite the program I've used the Python 3.6.8
